### Scrabble Letters

This was created as a way to play scrabble with English students in a video conference where the scrabble board was an image file and the letters were placed by writing them on to the board. This is a way to simulate choosing a letter from the 100 scrabble tiles with letter distribution that matches the official game.

- The âœ¨ emoji is used to represent the wildcard tile 
- Once a letter is picked by pressing the button, it is removed from the letter pool
